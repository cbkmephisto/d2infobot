# d2infobot

A telnet client served as a simple framework of chatting bot that connects to slashdiablo server.

Not working anymore for slashdiablo since I can't remember when.

 - They banned one of my accounts for "botting" (seriously!?!?)
 - They do check user permission on telnet connections now - standard users won't get connected.
 - Can be modified to connect to other similar servers, I think.


How a d2bnlogger looks in terminal if `/watch all` was switched on. It looks as if somebody was muling and someone else was chatting with an old friend:
